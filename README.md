This plugin gives WordPress Admin Panel users the ability to add fillable PDF attachments to email messages of Contact Form 7.

If the PDF attachment has a PDF form, the plugin allows users to add fields to the CF7 form and/or link them to fields in the PDF.  The plugin also allows the attached PDF files to be embedded with images supplied by the CF7 form fields.

When your website visitor submits the CF7 form, the form in the PDF file is filled with CF7 form information, images are embedded and the resulting PDF file is attached to the CF7 email message.

An external web API (https://pdf.ninja) is used for filling PDF forms (free usage has limitations).  An Enterprise Extension, which enables performing all PDF operations locally on your web server (no external web API), is available upon request.
